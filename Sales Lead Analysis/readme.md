Assumptions and recommendations for improvement on sales lead performances:

# Sales cycle time:
The sales cycle time which referes to the timeframe between a sales lead creation and sales lead winning was highest for Sales rep 5,sales rep 2 from Team 2 of UK.
High sales cycle time is an indication where sales reps spending too much time on individual clients or the clients are not being communicated effectively.
Assuming possible reasons:.
* Wrong target customers who might not were good fit for the product.
* Ineffective way of product presentation in first meeting.

#Possible steps for improvement:
*Have an indepth analysis of the sales cycle stages.
*Deciding if a customer has the affordability or is the right fit for the product before contacting.
* Improving first sales meeting strategies as most conversion rate depends a lot on first meting

#Team lead performance major insght :
Team 2 Working in UK created highest leads compared to others but the lead conversion rate was the lowest.

Managerial steps can be taken by
Going in depth about  the lead lost reason and trying to improve on that or give enhanced trainning to  representatives.
Finding out the possible lead  the reps are actually contacting or and judge if are actually a  good fit  to product or the right customer.
